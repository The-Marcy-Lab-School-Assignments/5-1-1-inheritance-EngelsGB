# Question

In a code snippet, demonstrate inheritance by creating two classes where one is the parent class and one is the child class.

In your code example, create an instance of the child class and reference/invoke a property/method of the parent class.

# Answer

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  feed(food) {
    console.log(`${this.name} likes the ${food}`);
  }
}

class Horse extends Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
  }
  kickPerson(name) {
    console.log(`${this.name} kicked ${name}!`);
  }
}

const juan = new Horse("Juan");
console.log(juan); // logs 'Horse { name: 'Juan' }'
juan.feed("apples"); // logs 'Juan likes the apples'
juan.kickPerson("Carlos"); // logs 'Juan kicked Carlos!'
```
