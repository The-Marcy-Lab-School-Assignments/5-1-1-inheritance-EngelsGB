# Question

What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer

Polymorphism is a practice in OOP in which subclasses and superclasses share the same names for methods even with different functionality so it's easier to use different subclasses from a superclass.

Example:

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  feed() {
    console.log(`${this.name} now seems more lively.`);
  }
}

class Horse extends Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
  }
  feed() {
    console.log(`${this.name} enjoys the apples.`);
  }
}

class Duck extends Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
  }
  feed() {
    console.log(`${this.name} starts picking at the pieces of bread.`);
  }
}

const miguel = new Animal("Miguel");
const juan = new Horse("Juan");
const frank = new Duck("Frank");
miguel.feed(); // logs 'Miguel now seems more lively.'
juan.feed(); // logs 'Juan enjoys the apples.'
frank.feed(); // logs 'Frank starts picking at the pieces of bread.'
```
